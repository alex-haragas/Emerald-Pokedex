106,Follow Me,1,,,20,"Almost always goes first. For the rest of the turn, all attacks from the opponent's team that target the user's team are redirected toward the user. In double battles, the user's teammate will not be protected from attacks that have more than one intended target."
107,Foresight,1,,100,40,"Until the target faints or switches, the user's Accuracy modifiers and the target's Evasion modifiers are ignored. Ghost-type targets also lose their immunities against Normal-type and Fighting-type moves."

111,Fury Cutter,7,10,95,20,"The base power of this move doubles with each consecutive hit; however, power is capped at a maximum 160 BP and remains there for any subsequent uses. If this move misses, or if the user selects another move, base power will be reset to 10 BP on the next turn."
112,Fury Swipes,1,10,80,15,"Attacks 2-5 times in one turn; if one of these attacks breaks a target's Substitute, the target will take damage for the rest of the hits.

113,Future Sight,14,80,90,15,"This move, even if the user and/or the target switch out, will strike the active target at the end of the second turn after its use. This move cannot cause a critical hit and its damage is calculated by using the original user's Special Attack and the original target's Special Defense. The move's damage is typeless so it never receives STAB and ignores weaknesses, resistances and immunities against this move's type. Only one instance of Future Sight or Doom Desire may be active at a time; because Future Sight is typeless and occurs at the end of the round, it also hits through Protect, Detect, Endure and Wonder Guard."
114,Giga Drain,12,60,100,5,Restores the user's HP by 1/2 of the damage inflicted on the target.
